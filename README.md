<h1>Google Project for The Odin Project</h1>
<h2>Preamble and Disclaimers</h2>
This project uses the Google Logo, and is an attempt to somewhat accurately reflect the google index and search pages. There is no backdoor functionality and is purely an educational exercise.

This project contains both the index and search pages and also uses *HTMLDoctor's reset css*.
